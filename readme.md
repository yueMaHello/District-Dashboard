# District Dashboard

## Description:
This is an web application using Arcgis WebAppBuilder Developer Edition. When you click on one district on the map, the dashboard will show charts to display different information of that district.
## Set up:
All the code is stored in 'C:\Users\tsengineer\Desktop\WebAppBuilderForArcGIS\server\apps\15'
## Run it:
Run 'C:\Users\tsengineer\Desktop\WebAppBuilderForArcGIS\startup.bat'.
Open a browser and go to 'http://mj04w12b.coe.ads:3344/webappbuilder/apps/15/'
## Update Dataset:
1. Open the folder 'C:\Users\tsengineer\Desktop\WebAppBuilderForArcGIS\server\apps\15\data'
2. You can see there are several csv files with clear names
3. You would be better to just update the data and keep the same file name; Otherwise, you have to look into the code.

## How to contribute to the App
'Yue's documentation' is provided.
You need to learn how the WAB works. The best resource should be YouTube.
One thing you should keep in mind is no matter which widges you want to update, you should change the code in ‘./WebAppBuilderForArcGIS/client/stemapp/widgets’, but not directly in 'server/apps/15'.
